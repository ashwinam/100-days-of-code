### Day 3: December 25, 2021 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: continue with django project, what i done is create a navbar using bootstrap, extend the base html to another html file using DTL(django template language) and take a data through todo form and print it on another html file 

#### Task Completed
- create a navbar using bootstrap cdn
- using DTL extends the single HTML file to All html files that way you dont need to copy paste 
- show the form data to new html file

**Thoughts** Today I got stuck while creating views, because the data was not showing, the reason was that I had not set the request method post, so that's why it took me more time to resolve this issue. But if feels Good That we Are progressing before that i directly go and search the google.
